+-----------------------------+


NOTE
----

All modifications are based on linux kernel version 4.20.4!

Tests passed on my i5-8300H machine by replacing stock kernel shipped with
Ubuntu 18.04.

-   nVidia GPU (GTX 1050M) not working with version 4.20.x, may need to re-
    install the driver, haven't tried.
-   HID-I2C trackpack is working (wasn't working on stock kernel, version
    4.15.x).

Usage
-----

1.  Get yourself a copy of linux source (dev is done on version 4.20.4 and
    tests passed, good luck with other versions).
2.  Replace ``arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl`` and
    ``arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c`` with modified versions provided in this
    folder.
3.  Compile the kernel.
4.  Write a small C program to test them out (say the ``test-mycopyfile.c``
    provided)!


The New System Calls
====================

myhelloworld (335)
------------------

Echos the starting point of all programs to the kernel ring buffer, and returns
the doubled only calling parameter.

Args:
    di: Some number.

Return:
    di * 2, or some random number if you forgot to pass the parameter.

mycopyfile (336)
----------------

Copy file specified by the first parameter to the path specified by the second.

Read and write are done in kernel state, which is bad practice, but still
doesn't change the fact that this is asked by the courseware.

Args:
    di: Pointer to source file path.
    si: Pointer to destination file path.

Return:
    0 if golden, -1 go consult ``dmesg``.
